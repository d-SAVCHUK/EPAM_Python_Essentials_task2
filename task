In order to test out your brand new python skills, we would like to suggest a little challenge for you.
Especially, function, that should find the roots of quadratic equation need to be implemented.
Quadratic equation should be in classic form: ax**2+bx+c=0, so a,b,c will be entered from user input
(don't forget to implement messages for user, who will use this script).

Python code should be splitted by few simple functions:

- main() here our program will be started, and all required data asked
- ask_value(message) this function should ask user for input, and then return variable.
Good to have additional input validation here.
- discriminant(a,b,c) no much, no less just return discriminant.
- roots(d,a,b,c) will show on the screen all acceptable roots
- solv_square(a,b,c) this function should contain inside discriminant and roots functions.

And that's all! If you will have the script created, and it's actually working
(you can enter variables, and after that roots will be shown on the screen) -
the task is successfully passed!
